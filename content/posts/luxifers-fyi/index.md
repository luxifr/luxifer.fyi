  Welcome to my blog. An attempt to share interesting tech stuff on an ongoing
  basis going forward.

---

Welcome to my blog. It's been probably literally half of my life at the time of
writing this since I've last had a blog (that I could think of). Over all those
years there's been times when I came across something I felt would be worth
sharing and making great content for a blog.

But I'm a lazy person with high standards, so actually standing up a new blog
seemed daunting. What about the performance? What about the maintenance? What
about the reliability? What about tieing together all the bits and pieces even
for a static site like this... and the process of keeping it up-to-date. All of
those things kept me from doing this for a long while.

However, I think I finally came up with something workable, and --- as you can
see --- I've put in the time to actually stand something up. I took the time to
stand it up properly, so that creating new content would be as low friction as
possible, and maintaining the blog from a technical standpoint would be as low
effort as possible.

With this blog I will try to focus on the technical side of things in my life,
maybe eventually creating a sister blog for all the other stuff, who knows ðŸ˜Š

Anyway, enough meta-talk. There's content in the pipeline... I just need to
write it down in a way that suits this format.
